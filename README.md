# UDACITY--Investigate-a-Relational-Database using SQL
The Sakila Movie database is a SQL database of online DVD rentals. I will query the database to answer questions about business decisions and plot my visualizations using python. 
These visualizations is then be used to answer these questions and serve as key justifications in a PowerPoint presentation.

This Database holds key information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, I will be querying the Sakila DVD Rental databasto gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance.
